# FITNESS TRACKER
<br>

## Description
<br>
<p>This is a simple application that allows the user to create and view daily workouts, track workouts by name, type, weight, reps, sets, and duration of exercise. Users are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they should be able to track the distance traveled.</p>
